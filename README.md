I developed and designed the Supercars Car Rental website, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enhanced the user experience by implementing intuitive navigation and responsive design, ensuring that the platform adapts seamlessly across various devices. I integrated external APIs to provide real-time vehicle availability, which allowed users to check car availability instantly. Additionally, I optimized the booking process to make it smooth and efficient, ensuring seamless data flow throughout the system. This approach improved the platformâ€™s overall performance, delivering a dynamic and engaging user experience for customers looking to rent high-end vehicles.
